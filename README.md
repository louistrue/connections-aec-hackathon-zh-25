<h2 id="overview">üîç Overview</h2>

This hackathon project is all about **Connection Detection and Visualization in Timber Construction**. It leverages modern web technologies such as [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) to:

- üé® **Visualize** IFC models with interactive 3D viewers.
- üîç **Detect** intersections and connections between building elements using robust raycasting and bounding-box checks.
- üóÇ **Explore** element properties with a dynamic model tree.
- üõ† **Export** custom IFC5 files with advanced overrides (thick walls, annotation surfaces, spheres, etc.).
- üìä **Analyze** connection data via CSV exports, PDF analyses, and automated image generation.

_Code isn't really clean, but it works well and is quite fast even on larger models._

<h2 id="challenge-details">üöÄ Challenge Details</h2>

**Challenge Title:** **Find the Connection**

This challenge focuses on the categorization and visualization of building element connections derived from an **abstract hull body model**. The goal is to quantify and categorize these connections efficiently within the wood construction industry.

### Wood Construction Industry Context

- **Precise Planning:** Detailed systems of building elements.
- **Prefabrication:** Based on 3D models and digitally controlled tools.
- **On-Site Connections:** Designed for easy and fast mounting.
- **Logistics:** Streamlined processes for assembly and installation.

For effective collaboration among companies, it is crucial to delineate both physical and digital interfaces within a unified 3D model.

### Partners & Contacts

- **Edyta Augustynowicz** ‚Äì BFH Berner Fachhochschule, Prof. Digital Fabrication and Wood.
- **Fabian Scheurer** ‚Äì HM Hochschule M√ºnchen, Prof. Digitale Bautechnologie & Fabrikation.
- **Michael Schaerschaerholzbau** ‚Äì Managing Director.

<h2 id="getting-started">üöÄ Getting Started</h2>

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (for the IFC Viewer)
- Python 3.6 or similiar (for export and analysis scripts)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies (for main IFC Viewer)**

   ```bash
   cd ifc-viewer
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the IFC Viewer**

   Start the development server using Vite:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Clone the Ifc5 viewer Repo - if you need it**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/buildingSMART/IFC5-development.git
   cd IFC5-development
   ```

4. **Run the Python Scripts - if you want to match pdf to model**

   From the repository root:

   ```bash
   python3 ifc5-export-test/create_ifc5_file.py
   python3 pdf_analysis/match_excel_pdf_and_upload.py
   ```

5. **Use the Demo Files to explore concepts applied in this project**

   Demo file paths:

   - [demo/raycast.html](demo/raycast.html)
   - [demo/explain.md](demo/explain.md)
   - [demo/01.html](demo/01.html)
   - [demo/02.html](demo/02.html)
   - [demo/03.html](demo/03.html)
   - [demo/explain.html](demo/explain.html)

<h2 id="usage">üõ† Usage</h2>

- **Loading Models:**  
  Use the file upload or URL input in [ifc5-viewer/index.html](ifc5-viewer/index.html) to load your IFC files.

- **Interacting with Models:**  
  Navigate using orbit controls; click on elements within the model tree to inspect detailed attributes.

- **Exploring Connections:**  
  Check connection data via the generated CSV ([pdf_analysis/extracted_ifc.csv](pdf_analysis/extracted_ifc.csv)) and refer to [demo/explain.md](demo/explain.md) and [demo/explain.html](demo/explain.html) for a deeper understanding.

- **Generating Custom IFC Files:**  
  We have a Button to export to Ifc5, developed and tested in [ifc5-export-test/](ifc5-export-test/) to produce IFC5 files with custom geometries and material overrides.

<h2 id="future-improvements">üîÆ Future Improvements</h2>

The following enhancements were discussed for possible future development:

### Window Detection & Processing

Implement automatic window detection within wall elements. Add logic to process rectangular openings in walls as window elements. Integrate window-specific property sets and parameters for comprehensive window management in the model structure.

### Geometric Analysis Enhancement for Connections

Add comprehensive geometric calculations including area calculations for all connections. This will enable more detailed quantitative analysis of the model connections.

### Wall Classification & Type Mapping

Implement smart selection and classification. E.g. let user set all outer walls as Typ01. Develop property-based automatic mapping to streamline classification processes.

### Reference Management

Enhance user input for connection references beyond simply using IfcNames. Support for custom component sorting and improved connection hierarchies and dependencies will enhance model accuracy and usability.

### Performance Optimization

Optimize raycast operations for improved accuracy - especially on linear objects like beams - through strategic point origins. Reduce unnecessary ray calculations and dinamically adjust number of rays based on object size.

### Visualization Improvements

Enhance 2D representation capabilities with focus on connecting elements. Implement toggle functionality for different visualization modes and develop improved visual feedback for connection points to provide better user experience with Snapshots.
